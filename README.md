## My process
I always start my projects with a mobile first approach . Once mobile is sorted I jump straight to desktop views . this makes my screens much more responsive . With this project I didnt have to worry too much about tablet views as they fall into desktop media queries 


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Its been awhile since I've touched code but I figured this was a good way to jump back in. A big refresher working with simple html and css. Flexbox was one of my css approaches . I look forward to working on other forntend mentor projects and working with external libraries such as jquery , bootstrap and angular as that has been my primary focus lately. 



### Continued development

I look  forward to using Jquery and Bootstrap 5 , Its been a while since Ive worked with the 2 .A lot of people may say jquery is depreciated but I still think its a really cool framework to know .
